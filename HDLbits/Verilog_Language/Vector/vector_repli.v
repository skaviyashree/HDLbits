/* Build a circuit that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits. This requires a concatenation of 24 copies of the sign bit (i.e., replicate bit[7] 24 times) followed by the 8-bit number itself. 

Examples:

{5{1'b1}}           // 5'b11111
{2{a,b,c}}          // The same as {a,b,c,a,b,c}
{3'd5, {2{3'd6}}}   // 9'b101_110_110. It's a concatenation of 101 with
                    // the second vector, which is two copies of 3'b110.
